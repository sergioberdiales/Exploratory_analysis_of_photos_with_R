The objective of this script is to make an exploratory analysis of the photos I took during my holidays at Boston last summer. Something very simple and descriptive.

First of all is to load the packages to use. Besides the "usual suspects" (dplyr, ggplot, tidyr, etc.) I am going to use a very useful package for photographers. Its name is exifR and it is going to help us to extract the metadata from our photos.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(xlsx)
library(readr)
library(rmarkdown)
```
